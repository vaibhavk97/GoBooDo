GoBooDo is a **python3** program for downloading **previewable** books on Google books. It downloads high resolution images of pages and combines them to save the file as a PDF. 
# Usage
For downloading a book GoBooDo requires the book id which can be fetched from the url of the book. For instance consider the example below:
~~~
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XUwOtdcIWdkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false
~~~
in this url the id=XXX is the part we are interested in.

To start downloading:
~~~
python GoBooDo.py --id=XUwOtdcIWdkC
~~~

The configuration can be done in the settings.json and the description is as follows:
~~~
{
  "country":"co.in", // The TLD for the service that is being used for example books.google.co.in or books.google.de
  "page_resolution": 1500, // The resoution of page in dpi.
  "tesseract_path": "C:\\program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe", // The path for tesseract engine if not available via environment variables. E.g. on linux Ubuntu this looks like "tesseract_path": "/usr/bin/tesseract",
  "proxy_links":0,   // 0 for disabling proxy when fetching page links upon reaching the limit.
  "proxy_images":0,  // 0 for disabling proxy when fetching  page images upon reaching the limit.
  "max_retry_links":1, // Max retries for fetching a link using proxies.
  "max_retry_images":1, // Max retries for a fetching a image using proxies.
  "global_retry_time":30, // 0 for not running GoBooDo indefinitely, the number of seconds of delay between each global retry otherwise.
  "lang": "" // "" for create PDF without OCR, languages which OCR reads in. E.g. "eng+ita".
}
~~~

The output will be saved as a folder named the 'id' of the book which was given as input. The final PDF will be in the output folder inside it along with a folder containing the images.
Proxies may be added in proxies.txt (a sample proxy has been added already).

GooBoDo now uses Tesseract for identifying empty images fetched from valid links. Please configure Tesseract prior to avoid any errors related to it. The path in settings is used for Windows installation. Please configure Tesseract for a linux distribution accordingly.

The breakup of the files downloaded is as follows:
~~~
    "data/obstinatePages.pkl": Pages which are to be fetched in the subsequent iterations.
    "data/pageLinkDict.pkl": A dictionary of pages and their links.
    "data/pagesFetched.pkl": Pages which have been fetched already.
    "Images/": All the images which have been downloaded for the current book.
    "Output/": The PDF of the current book.
~~~
 
# Dependencies
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` for installing all the packages at once.
~~~
requests
bs4
Pillow
fpdf
html5lib
tqdm
pytesseract
pypdf2
~~~

If you want to use OCR with languages other than English, you should download aditional languages data from [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr).

# Features 
1. Stateful : GoBooDo keeps a track of the books which are downloaded. In each subsequent iterations of operation only those those links and images are fetched which were not downloaded earlier.
2. Proxy support : Since Google limits the amount of pages accessible to each individual majorly on the basis of IP address, GoBooDo uses proxies for circumventing that limit and maximizing the number of pages that can be accessed in the preview.

# Todo
1. Add proxy integration with a checker.
2. Make the system more robust from being detected by google.
